# Blender Add-On: Screen-Space Hatch Lines

This Blender 4.4+ add-on draws hatch lines of the scene as Grease Pencil v3 strokes.
The hatch lines are computed with a screen-space algorithm following Jobard and Leferâ€™s paper from 1997 on "Creating Evenly-Spaced Streamlines of Arbitrary Density."
The input data for the algorithm is computed via a custom fragment shader.
